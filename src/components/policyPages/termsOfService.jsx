            <p><strong>Users of the Apple Platform.</strong> If you download and use our iPhone or iPad App: You, the end-user of this Platform, acknowledge that this agreement is entered into by and between Frito-Lay and you and not with Apple, Inc., and Apple, Inc. is not responsible for the Platform and/or its content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you acknowledge that Apple, Inc. and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement and that Apple, Inc. has the right (and is deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this agreement. You acknowledge that Apple, Inc. has no obligation whatsoever to maintain or support the Platform. You acknowledge that you have reviewed the App Store Terms and Conditions (located online at <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#APPS">http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#APPS</a>). This agreement incorporates by reference the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (the “LAEULA”) published by Apple, Inc. (located online at: http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/). For purposes of this Agreement, the Platform is considered the “Licensed Application” as defined in the LAEULA and Frito-Lay is considered the “Application Provider” as defined in the LAEULA. If any terms of this Agreement conflict with the terms of the LAEULA, the terms of this agreement shall control. You further acknowledge and agree that in no event will Apple, Inc. be responsible for any claims relating to the Platform (including, without limitation, a third party claim that the Platform infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights) or your use or possession of the Platform, including but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Platform fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

            <p><strong>Assignment.</strong> Frito-Lay may assign this agreement, in whole or in part, at any time with or without notice to you.

You may not transfer to anyone else, either temporarily or permanently, any rights to use all or any part of the Platform. To the extent that you allow a third party to use your device, you shall remain solely responsible for the use of the Platform by others using the device.</p>

            <p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Platform, use of the Platform, or these Terms shall be settled by binding arbitration in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (“JAMS Rules and Procedures”), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms of this Agreement if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. If you initiate arbitration against Frito-Lay, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator’s services or any other JAMS fees. In the event that the claimant is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, Frito-Lay will pay as much of the claimant’s filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither claimant nor Frito-Lay shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. <strong>THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.</strong></p>

            <p><strong>General Information.</strong> Both you and Frito-Lay acknowledge and agree that no partnership is formed and neither of you nor Frito-Lay has the power or the authority to obligate or bind the other.</p>

            <p>By using the Platform, you agree that the statutes and laws of the United States and the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws principles, will apply to all matters relating to use of the Platform, and you agree that with respect to any dispute not subject to binding arbitration any litigation shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts for New York, New York, USA. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Platform or this agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The foregoing limitation is not applicable to residents of New Jersey. You further agree that any disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with the Platform and/or this agreement, will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.

If Frito-Lay fails to act with respect to your breach or anyone else's breach on any occasion, Frito-Lay is not waiving its right to act with respect to future or similar breaches.</p>

            <p>If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms of use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
